USAGE
========
1 Put the data folder in the /data and rename it with the name of the problem
2 Put the code folder in the /src and rename it with the name of the participator
3 Check the request.yaml and change it with the form you wish
4 $ python test.py
5 Check the result.yaml

TIPS
========
1 An a+b problem saved as problem '10000' is already in the /data
2 Some participator is already in the /src such as /AC /TLE /WA /RE

DRAWBACK
========
1 Can not support special judge at present (the 'line' in the testmode means compare by the lines)
