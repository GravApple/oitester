# Introducton

Executor is a utility to run and monitor untrustful programs. It can be used only in 64-bit Linux platform.
It is designed to work for an online judge application. In detail, it can receive source code file and language
name(currently cpp, c and pascal), compile it and then run it, at the same time monitor the time and memory usage.
In addtional, Executor can protect your system from hostile system calls like `rm * -rf'. But as a result user has
to specify the system call limits and available safe files. You can look into the `src' folder to find `compiler.ini',
`safe_files_ini' and `syscall_ini' as an example.

For example, you have a `hello.cpp` need to execute, and you have `compiler.ini', `safe_files_ini' and `syscall_ini' in
the same directory, use `_.in' as a input file by default, then do

$ executor hello.cpp cpp

After that, you can find a `log' file with the results.

# Install

$ aclocal & autoconf
$ automake --add-missing
$ ./configure
$ make

Then the executable `executor' is available in `src', and the doc is also generated in `doc'.

$ make install

Then the executable is installed to `/usr/local/bin' and the doc is installed to `/usr/local/share/doc/executor' by default.
You can use `--prefix=<DIR>' to change the default destination.

# Uninstall

Simply do the following command:

$ make uninstall
